=head1 NAME

Lingua::Stem::UniNE - University of Neuchâtel stemmers

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Lingua::Stem::UniNE v0.03_1.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::Stem::UniNE;

    # create Bulgarian stemmer
    $stemmer = Lingua::Stem::UniNE->new(language => 'bg');

    # get stem for word
    $stem = $stemmer->stem($word);

    # get list of stems for list of words
    @stems = $stemmer->stem(@words);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains a collection of stemmers for multiple languages based on
stemming algorithms provided by Jacques Savoy of the University of Neuchâtel
(UniNE).  The languages currently implemented are
L<Bulgarian|Lingua::Stem::UniNE::BG>, L<Czech|Lingua::Stem::UniNE::CS>, and
L<Persian|Lingua::Stem::UniNE::FA>.  Work is ongoing for Arabic, Bengali,
Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Marathi,
Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.  The top priority is languages for which there
are no stemmers available on CPAN.

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item language

The following language codes are currently supported.

    ┌───────────┬────┐
    │ Bulgarian │ bg │
    │ Czech     │ cs │
    │ Persian   │ fa │
    └───────────┴────┘

They are in the two-letter ISO 639-1 format and are case-insensitive but are
always returned in lowercase when requested.

    # instantiate a stemmer object
    $stemmer = Lingua::Stem::UniNE->new(language => $language);

    # get current language
    $language = $stemmer->language;

    # change language
    $stemmer->language($language);

Country codes such as C<cz> for the Czech Republic are not supported, nor are
IETF language tags such as C<fa-AF> or C<fa-IR>.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item stem

Accepts a list of words, stems each word, and returns a list of stems.  The list
returned will always have the same number of elements in the same order as the
list provided.  When no stemming rules apply to a word, the original word is
returned.

    @stems = $stemmer->stem(@words);

    # get the stem for a single word
    $stem = $stemmer->stem($word);

The words should be provided as character strings and the stems are returned as
character strings.  Byte strings in arbitrary character encodings are
intentionally not supported.

=item languages

Returns a list of supported two-letter language codes using lowercase letters.

    # object method
    @languages = $stemmer->languages;

    # class method
    @languages = Lingua::Stem::UniNE->languages;

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<IR Multilingual Resources at UniNE|http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/>
provides the original stemming algorithms that were implemented in this module.

L<Lingua::Stem::Any> provides a unified interface to any stemmer on CPAN,
including this module, as well as additional features like normalization,
casefolding, and in-place stemming.

L<Lingua::Stem::Snowball> provides alternate stemming algorithms for Finnish,
French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish,
as well as other languages.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

L<Jacques Savoy|http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/> and Ljiljana Dolamic of
the University of Neuchâtel authored the original stemming algorithms that were
implemented in this module.
