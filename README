NAME
    Lingua::Stem::UniNE - University of Neuchâtel stemmers

VERSION
    This document describes Lingua::Stem::UniNE v0.00_1.

SYNOPSIS
        use Lingua::Stem::UniNE;

        # create Bulgarian stemmer
        $stemmer = Lingua::Stem::UniNE->new(language => 'bg');

        # get stem for word
        $stem = $stemmer->stem($word);

        # get list of stems for list of words
        @stems = $stemmer->stem(@words);

        # replace words in array reference with stems
        $stemmer->stem(\@words);

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains a collection of stemmers for multiple languages
    based on stemming algorithms provided by Jacques Savoy of the University
    of Neuchâtel. The languages currently implemented are Bulgarian, Czech,
    and Persian. Work is ongoing for Arabic, Bengali, Finnish, French,
    German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Marathi, Russian,
    Spanish, and Swedish. The top priority is languages for which there are
    no stemmers available on CPAN.

  Attributes
    language
        The following language codes are currently supported.

            ┌───────────┬────┐
            │ Bulgarian │ bg │
            │ Czech     │ cs │
            │ Persian   │ fa │
            └───────────┴────┘

        They are in the two-letter ISO 639-1 format and are case-insensitive
        but are always returned in lowercase when requested.

            $stemmer = Lingua::Stem::UniNE->new(language => $language);

            # get current language
            $language = $stemmer->language;

            # change language
            $stemmer->language($language);

        Country codes such as "cz" for the Czech Republic are not supported,
        nor are IETF language tags such as "pt-PT" or "pt-BR".

  Methods
    stem
        When a list of strings is provided, each string is stemmed and a
        list of stems is returned. The list returned will always have the
        same number of elements as the list provided.

            @stems = $stemmer->stem(@words);

            # get the stem for a single word
            $stem = $stemmer->stem($word);

        When an array reference is provided, each element is stemmed and
        replaced with the resulting stem.

            $stemmer->stem(\@words);

        The words should be provided as character strings and the stems are
        returned as character strings. Byte strings in arbitrary character
        encodings are not supported.

    languages
        Returns a list of supported two-letter language codes using
        lowercase letters.

            @languages = $stemmer->languages;

SEE ALSO
    IR Multilingual Resources at UniNE
    <http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/> provides the original
    stemming algorithms that were implemented in this module.

    Lingua::Stem::Snowball provides alternate stemming algorithms for
    Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian,
    Spanish, and Swedish, as well as other languages.

    Lingua::Stem::Any provides a consistent unified interface for
    Lingua::Stem::UniNE, Lingua::Stem::Snowball, and other stemming modules
    on CPAN.
