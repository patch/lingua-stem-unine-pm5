This directory contains the original source code from the University of
Neuch√¢tel for all of their stemmers.  It is intended to be stored in the
Lingua::Stem::UniNE project repository, but not the packaged CPAN distribution,
for the purpose of comparing with the UniNE-hosted files for updates.

To download all the known stemmers from UniNE into the current directory, run
the fetch-stemmers script.

./fetch-stemmers
